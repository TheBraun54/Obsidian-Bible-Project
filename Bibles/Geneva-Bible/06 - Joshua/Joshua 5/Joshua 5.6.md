For the children of Israel walked fourtie yeres in the wildernes, till all the people of the men of warre that came out of Egypt were consumed, because they obeyed not the voyce of the Lord: vnto whome the Lord sware, that he would not shewe them the lande, which the Lorde had sworne vnto their fathers, that he would giue vs, euen a land that floweth with milke and hony.
