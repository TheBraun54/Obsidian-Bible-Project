Vntill the Lord haue giuen your brethren rest, as well as to you, and vntill they also shall possesse the land, which the Lorde your God giueth them: then shall ye returne vnto the lande of your possession and shall possesse it, which land Moses the Lordes seruant gaue you on this side Iorden toward the sunne rising.
