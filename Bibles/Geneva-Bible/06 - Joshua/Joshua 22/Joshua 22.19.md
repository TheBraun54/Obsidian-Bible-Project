Notwithstanding if the land of your possession be vncleane, come ye ouer vnto the land of the possession of the Lord, wherein the Lordes Tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among vs: but rebell not against the Lorde, nor rebell not against vs in building you an altar, beside the altar of the Lord our God.
