(4:16) Then Daniel (whose name was Belteshazzar) held his peace by the space of one houre, and his thoughts troubled him, & the King spake and said, Belteshazzar, let neither the dreame, nor the interpretation thereof trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and saide, My lord, the dreame be to them that hate thee, and the interpretation thereof to thine enemies.
