Wherefore Nebuchad-nezzar spake & said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who hath sent his Angel, and deliuered his seruants, that put their trust in him, and haue changed the Kings commaundement, and yeelded their bodies rather then they would serue or worship any god, saue their owne God.
