Now therefore are ye ready when ye heare the sound of the cornet, trumpet, harpe, sackebut, psalterie, and dulcimer, and all instruments of musike, to fall downe, and worship the image, which I haue made? For if ye worship it not, ye shall be cast immediately into the middes of an hote fierie fornace: for who is that God, that can deliuer you out of mine handes?
