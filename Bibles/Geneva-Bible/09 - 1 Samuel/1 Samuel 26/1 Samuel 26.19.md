Now therefore, I beseech thee, let my lord the King heare the wordes of his seruant. If the Lord haue stirred thee vp against me, let him smel the sauour of a sacrifice: but if the children of men haue done it, cursed be they before the Lorde: for they haue cast me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the Lorde, saying, Goe, serue other gods.
