To him that excelleth vpon Shushan Eduth, or Michtam. A Psalme of Dauid to teach. When he fought against Aram Naharaim, & against Aram Zobah, when Ioab returned and slewe twelue thousand Edomites in the salt valley. O God, thou hast cast vs out, thou hast scattered vs, thou hast bene angry, turne againe vnto vs.
