If any person transgresse & sinne through ignorance by taking away things consecrated vnto the Lorde, hee shall then bring for his trespasse offring vnto the Lorde a ramme without blemish out of the flocke, worth two shekels of siluer by thy estimation after the shekel of the Sanctuarie, for a trespasse offring.
