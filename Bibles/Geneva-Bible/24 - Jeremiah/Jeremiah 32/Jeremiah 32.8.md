So Hanameel, mine vncles sonne, came to mee in the court of the prison, according to the word of the Lord, & said vnto me, Bye my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the countrey of Beniamin: for the right of the possession is thine, & the purchase belongeth vnto thee: bye it for thee. Then I knewe that this was the worde of the Lord.
