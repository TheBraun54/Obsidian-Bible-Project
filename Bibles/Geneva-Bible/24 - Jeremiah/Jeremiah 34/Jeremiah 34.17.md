Therefore thus saith the Lord, Ye haue not obeyed mee, in proclayming freedome euery man to his brother, and euery man to his neighbour: beholde, I proclaime a libertie for you, saith the Lorde, to the sworde, to the pestilence, and to the famine, and I will make you a terrour to all the kingdomes of the earth.
