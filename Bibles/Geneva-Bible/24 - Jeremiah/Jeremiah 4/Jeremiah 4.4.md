Breake vp your fallowe ground, and sowe not among the thornes: be circumcised to the Lord, & take away the foreskinnes of your hearts, ye men of Iudah, and inhabitants of Ierusalem, lest my wrath come foorth like fire, and burne, that none can quenche it, because of the wickednesse of your inuentions.
