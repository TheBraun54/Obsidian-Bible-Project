Which saide vnto me, Sonne of man, this place is my throne, & the place of the soles of my feete, whereas I will dwell among the children of Israel for euer, & the house of Israel shal no more defile mine holy Name, neither they, nor their Kings by their fornication, nor by the carkeises of their Kings in their high places.
