Therefore ye mountaines of Israel, heare the worde of the Lord God, Thus sayth the Lord God to the mountaines & to the hilles, to the riuers, and to the valleys, and to the waste, and desolate places, and to the cities that are forsaken: which are spoyled & had in derision of the residue of the heathen that are round about.
