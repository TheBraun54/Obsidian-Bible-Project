Go ye and inquire of the Lord for me, & for the people, and for all Iudah concerning the wordes of this booke that is founde: for great is the wrath of the Lorde that is kindled against vs, because our fathers haue not obeyed the wordes of this booke, to doe according vnto all that which is written therein for vs.
