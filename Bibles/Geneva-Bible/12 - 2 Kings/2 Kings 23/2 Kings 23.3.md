And the King stood by the pillar, & made a couenant before the Lorde, that they shoulde walke after the Lord, and keepe his commandements, and his testimonies, and his statutes with all their heart, and with all their soule, that they might accomplish the wordes of this couenant written in this booke; all the people stood to the couenant.
