[For the Chief Musician; set to Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand]. O God thou hast cast us off, thou hast broken us down; Thou hast been angry; oh restore us again.
