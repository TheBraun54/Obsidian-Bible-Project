**Description**:
a (middle voice) prolonged form of the primary (middle voice)        ;    which is used for it in certain                                   tenses; and both as alternate of                                   ὁράω; to gaze (i.e. with wide-open eyes, as at something remarkable; and thus differing from βλέπω, which denotes simply voluntary observation; and from εἴδω, which expresses merely mechanical, passive or casual vision; while θεάομαι, and still more emphatically its intensive θεωρέω, signifies an earnest but more continued inspection; and σκοπέω a watching from a distance):--appear, look, see, shew self.
