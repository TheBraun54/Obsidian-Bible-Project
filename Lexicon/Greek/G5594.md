**Lemma**: ψύχω

**Transliteration (xlit)**: psýchō

**Pronunciation**: psoo'-kho

**Description**:
a primary verb; to breathe (voluntarily but gently, thus differing on the one hand from πνέω, which denotes properly a forcible respiration; and on the other from the base of ἀήρ, which refers properly to an inanimate breeze), i.e. (by implication, of reduction of temperature by  evaporation) to chill (figuratively):--wax cold.
