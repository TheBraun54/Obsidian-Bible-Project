**Lemma**: τύπτω

**Transliteration (xlit)**: týptō

**Pronunciation**: toop'-to

**Description**:
a primary verb (in a strengthened form); to "thump", i.e. cudgel or pummel (properly, with a stick or bastinado), but in any case by repeated blows; thus differing from παίω and πατάσσω, which denote a (usually single) blow with the hand or any instrument, or πλήσσω with the fist (or a hammer), or ῥαπίζω with the palm; as well as from τυγχάνω, an accidental collision); by implication, to punish; figuratively, to offend (the conscience):--beat, smite, strike, wound.
