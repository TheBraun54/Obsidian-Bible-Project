# Lexicon Entry G4441

**Lemma**: πυνθάνομαι

**Transliteration (xlit)**: pynthánomai

**Pronunciation**: poon-than'-om-ahee

**Description**:
middle voice prolonged from a primary  (which occurs only as an alternate in certain tenses); to question, i.e. ascertain by inquiry (as a matter of information merely; and thus differing from ἐρωτάω, which properly means a request as a favor; and from αἰτέω, which is strictly a demand for something due; as well as from ζητέω, which implies a search for something hidden; and from δέομαι, which involves the idea of urgent need); by implication, to learn (by casual intelligence):--ask, demand, enquire, understand.
