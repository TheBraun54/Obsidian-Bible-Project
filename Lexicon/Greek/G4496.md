# Lexicon Entry G4496

**Lemma**: ῥίπτω

**Transliteration (xlit)**: rhíptō

**Pronunciation**: hrip'-to

**Description**:
a primary verb (perhaps rather akin to the base of ῥαπίζω, through the idea of sudden motion); to fling (properly, with a quick toss, thus differing from βάλλω, which denotes a deliberate hurl; and from  (see in ἐκτείνω), which indicates an extended projection); by qualification, to deposit (as if a load); by extension, to disperse:--cast (down, out), scatter abroad, throw.
