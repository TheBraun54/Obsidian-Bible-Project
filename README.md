# Obsidian-Bible-Project

## Overview
This project contains multiple versions of the Bible, converted into **Markdown files**. Each **verse** is stored in its own file, making it easy to reference and link individual verses within Obsidian. This setup is ideal for note-taking, personal study, or creating a network of cross-references across different Bible versions in my eyes. 

### Why Verse-by-Verse Files?
The primary reason for structuring the Bible this way is to facilitate easy linking and referencing. In tools like **Obsidian**, you can easily link specific verses that come to mind while taking notes, creating a more flexible and connected Bible study experience.

## Setup

### Importing into Obsidian
To set this up in your **Obsidian Vault**, I recommend the following:

1. **Copy and Paste**: Simply copy one of the Bible version folders into your Obsidian vault.
2. **Start Linking**: Once in your vault, you can start linking individual verses or entire chapters. With each verse in its own file, this makes it easy to reference or cross-reference.

### Strongâ€™s Concordance Integration
For those interested in deeper study, some of the Bible versions in this project end with **Strong**. These versions include additional files for **Greek and Hebrew lexicons**, which can be extremely helpful for studying the original languages of the Bible.

- The files are structured so that each verse can be cross-referenced with its Strong's number and corresponding lexicon entry for Greek or Hebrew terms.
- There is an individual file for each Greek or Hebrew word

## Miscellaneous

### Reference Files
The project includes **scripts** and **CSV files** that are useful for:

- **Generating your own Bible versions**: You can use the CSV files or the scripts to create your own Bible files, such as generating a file per **chapter** instead of **verse**.
- **Customizing**: If you'd like to adapt the content for your own study or application, the scripts can serve as a good starting point.

### Total Files Breakdown
- **Verses**: There are a total of **31,102 verses** in the Bible.
- **Chapters**: The Bible contains **1,189 chapters**.

The verse-by-verse breakdown gives you **more granular control**, but the chapter-based organization is also available through the scripts if you'd prefer to work with entire chapters.

## How to Use
1. **Linking Verses**: In Obsidian, you can create a note for a verse (e.g., `John 3:16.md`), and when you mention that verse in another note, you can link to it like so: `[[John 3:16]]`. This creates a direct link to the individual verse file.
2. **Cross-Referencing**: By linking verses, you can quickly cross-reference related verses and build a web of connections. This is particularly useful for topical studies or creating your own personal commentary.
